# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Installing with npm
Once you have node installed on your machine, you'll need few extra packages.  To install them from the project root, use these commands:


```npm install express```

```npm install cors```

```npm install body-parser```
